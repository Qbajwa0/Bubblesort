# Bubblesort
The primary objective of this homework was to optimize the compiler generated assembly code from the given MIPS and C++ programs. We then measure how much the optimizations improved our runtime. Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based algorithm, where adjacent elements are swapped if they are out of order.
